Hi all,
I'm pleased to announce a GUI editor for Orthanc.json file.

This software allows you to edit the Orthanc.json file through a GUI with settings by settings control and generate a new orthanc.Json with your personal settings.

This software handles all settings of the Orthanc.json (except 3 exceptions of parameters very rarely used).

You can also restart Orthanc from this software to take account of the new orthanc.json

The software is written in Java, should work on all platform (tested on Linux and Windows) and is open source.

The software can be downloaded here : https://github.com/salimkanoun/Ortanc_Json_Editor/releases/download/0.9/OrthancEditor.jar

The sources are on the same GitHub.

Due to the large number of parameters, even carefully coded, I can't exclude some bugs, so please report if you find one (salim.kanoun@gmail.com).
